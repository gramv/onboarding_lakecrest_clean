# Voided Check Database Issue - Analysis

## Issue Found in Backend Logs

```
INFO:app.main_enhanced:✅ Signed Direct Deposit PDF uploaded successfully: None
ERROR:app.main_enhanced:Failed to save Direct Deposit PDF URL to progress: 'EnhancedSupabaseService' object has no attribute 'save_onboarding_progress'
```

## Root Cause

The voided check/bank letter **IS being saved to the database** successfully:
- ✅ File uploaded to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Metadata saved to `signed_documents` table
- ✅ Signed URL generated

**However**, there's a secondary error when trying to save the PDF URL to the progress tracking table because the method `save_onboarding_progress` doesn't exist on `EnhancedSupabaseService`.

## Location

**File:** `backend/app/main_enhanced.py`  
**Lines:** Around 12150-12170 (Direct Deposit PDF generation endpoint)

## The Fix

The code is trying to call a method that doesn't exist:
```python
# This method doesn't exist
supabase_service.save_onboarding_progress(
    employee_id=employee_id,
    step_id='direct-deposit',
    data={...}
)
```

Should use the existing method pattern from other steps.

## Status

- ✅ **Voided check/bank letter ARE being saved to database**
- ❌ **Progress tracking fails** (non-critical - doesn't affect document storage)
- ✅ **Document metadata in `signed_documents` table is complete**

## Fix Required

Remove or fix the `save_onboarding_progress` call in the Direct Deposit PDF generation endpoint.
