## 10. Conclusion

The Hotel Employee Onboarding System has a solid foundation of tests, particularly in backend integration and federal compliance areas. However, significant gaps exist in:

1. **Frontend component testing** (60% of components lack tests)
2. **End-to-end workflow testing** (critical business flows untested)
3. **Manager verification workflows** (I-9 Section 2 gaps)
4. **Performance and load testing** (no stress tests)
5. **Error recovery scenarios** (limited negative testing)

### Recommended Investment
- **2 weeks**: Close critical testing gaps
- **1 month**: Achieve 80% coverage target
- **Ongoing**: Maintain test-driven development

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Untested I-9 Section 2 workflow
- **Medium Risk**: Missing E2E tests for onboarding
- **Low Risk**: Utility function coverage gaps
