# I-9 Document Upload API Documentation

      "is_valid": false,
      "errors": [
        {
          "field": "documents",
          "message": "FEDERAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: List C document required when not using List A",
          "legal_code": "USCIS-I9-NO-LIST-C",

        }
      ]
    },
    "compliance_status": "non_compliant"
  }
}
```

### Expired Document
```json

  "success": false,
  "data": {
    "federal_validation": {
      "is_valid": false,
      "errors": [
        {
          "field": "documents",
          "message": "List A document is expired (expired: 2020-01-15)",
          "legal_code": "USCIS-I9-EXPIRED-DOC",
          "severity": "error"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Database Setup

Before using these endpoints, create the `i9_documents` table in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Run the migration script:
-- migrations/create_i9_documents_table.sql
```

## Single-Step Invitation Support

These endpoints fully support single-step invitations where employees may not have permanent IDs yet:

1. **Temporary Employee IDs**: Endpoints accept IDs like `temp_xxx` for employees who haven't completed registration
2. **No Authentication Required**: Endpoints use optional authentication to allow document upload before account creation
3. **Document Persistence**: Documents are stored and linked to temporary IDs, then transferred when permanent employee record is created

## Security Considerations

1. **File Size Limit**: Maximum 10MB per file
2. **File Types**: Only JPEG, PNG, and PDF files accepted
3. **Storage**: Files are encrypted and stored in Supabase Storage with signed URLs
4. **Access Control**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure employees can only view their own documents
5. **Audit Trail**: All document operations are logged for compliance

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify implementation:

```bash
python test_i9_documents.py
```

This will test:
- List A document upload
- List B + C document combination
- Document retrieval
- Validation logic
- Invalid combination detection

## Compliance Notes

- Documents must be retained for 3 years after hire date or 1 year after termination (whichever is later)
- Expired documents cannot be accepted (except expired U.S. passports in some cases)
- Social Security cards marked "NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT" are not acceptable List C documents
- Receipts for replacement documents are temporary and actual documents must be provided within 90 days
