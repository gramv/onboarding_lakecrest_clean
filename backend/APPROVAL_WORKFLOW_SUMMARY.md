- `/app/auth.py` - JWT token generation for onboarding

### Frontend Files:
- `/src/components/dashboard/ApplicationsTab.tsx` - Full UI implementation

### Database Tables Used:
- `job_applications` - Stores applications
- `employees` - Created on approval
- `onboarding_sessions` - Stores onboarding tokens
- `users` - Manager authentication
- `property_managers` - Property access control

## üìä Test Results

All components tested successfully:
```
‚úÖ Manager Authentication
‚úÖ Applications List Endpoint
‚úÖ Application Approval
‚úÖ Onboarding Token Generation (JWT)
‚úÖ Application Rejection
‚úÖ Talent Pool Management
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Testing:
1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python3 setup_approval_workflow.py
   ```

2. Run comprehensive tests:
   ```bash
   python3 test_complete_approval_flow.py
   ```

### For Manual Testing:
1. Login to Manager Dashboard:
   - URL: http://localhost:3000/manager
   - Email: testmanager@demo.com
   - Password: password123

2. Navigate to Applications tab

3. Click "Approve" on a pending application:
   - Fill in job offer details
   - Submit to generate onboarding token

4. Click "Reject" to move to talent pool

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /manager/applications` - List applications
- `POST /applications/{id}/approve` - Approve with job offer
- `POST /applications/{id}/reject` - Reject to talent pool
- `GET /hr/applications/talent-pool` - View talent pool

## üîê Security Features

- JWT tokens with 72-hour expiration
- Property-based access control
- Manager can only see/approve their property's applications
- Audit trail for all status changes
- Secure token generation using cryptographically secure methods

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Onboarding Token**: Valid for 72 hours, contains employee_id for stateless employee access
2. **Property Isolation**: Managers only see applications for their assigned properties
3. **Talent Pool**: Rejected applications automatically move to talent pool for future consideration
4. **Email Notifications**: Sent on approval (currently prints to console in dev mode)

## üéØ Next Steps

The approval workflow is fully functional. Potential enhancements:
- Bulk approval/rejection operations
- Customizable email templates
- Schedule onboarding start dates
- Integration with background check services
- Analytics dashboard for application metrics
