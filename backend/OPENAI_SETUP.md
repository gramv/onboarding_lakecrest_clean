# OpenAI GPT-5 Setup for Void Check Validation

## Overview
The void check validation system has been migrated from Groq API to OpenAI, configured to use GPT-5 as primary model with GPT-4o as fallback.

## Environment Configuration

Add the following environment variable to your system:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key for void check OCR processing
# Add this to your .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

## Model Configuration

### Primary Model: GPT-5
- Model: `gpt-5`
- Status: ⚠️ Configured as primary but requires API access upgrade
- Released: August 2025
- Benefits: 45% fewer hallucinations, 74.9% accuracy on real-world tasks
- Cost: $1.25/1M input tokens, $10/1M output tokens

### Fallback Model: GPT-4o
- Model: `gpt-4o`
- Status: ✅ Currently active (automatic fallback when GPT-5 unavailable)
- Uses: Standard `chat.completions.create` API with vision
- Proven reliable for OCR tasks

## Changes Made (December 2025)

1. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Using `openai==1.107.1` (latest version as of Sept 2025)
   - Completely removed Groq API dependency

2. **Updated Service** (`app/voided_check_ocr_service.py`)
   - Configured GPT-5 as primary model (full accuracy version)
   - GPT-4o as automatic fallback (proven reliability)
   - Removed GPT-5-mini and GPT-5-nano variants
   - Maintained robust error handling and JSON parsing

3. **Updated Main Application** (`app/main_enhanced.py`)
   - Uses OpenAI client with OPENAI_API_KEY from environment
   - Removed dead `/ocr-check` endpoint (was using undefined Groq)
   - Removed `/ocr-rate-limit-status` endpoint (orphaned)
   - Main endpoint `/api/onboarding/{employee_id}/direct-deposit/validate-check` fully functional

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file
   - Removed GROQ_API_KEY and GROQ_MODEL variables
   - API key now loaded from environment (no hardcoding)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the integration:

```bash
cd /Users/gouthamvemula/onbclaude/onbdev-production/hotel-onboarding-backend
python3 test_openai_void_check.py
```

## API Endpoint

The void check validation endpoint remains the same:

```
POST /api/onboarding/{employee_id}/direct-deposit/validate-check
```

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is still in place:
- 10 requests per minute per IP
- 50 requests per hour per employee

## Migration Status

✅ **Complete** - System fully migrated to OpenAI with GPT-5/GPT-4o configuration

**Current State:**
- ✅ GPT-5 configured as primary model (awaiting API access upgrade)
- ✅ GPT-4o actively working as automatic fallback
- ✅ All Groq dependencies removed
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Test suite passing with fallback mechanism
- ✅ Rate limiting maintained (10 req/min per IP, 50 req/hour per employee)

**API Access Note:**
The system is configured to use GPT-5 but currently falls back to GPT-4o due to API access restrictions. Once your OpenAI API key is upgraded to include GPT-5 access, the system will automatically use it without code changes.

**To Enable GPT-5:**
1. Upgrade your OpenAI API account to include GPT-5 access
2. No code changes needed - the fallback mechanism handles this automatically
3. Monitor logs to confirm GPT-5 is being used once access is granted
