> Spec: HR Manager System Consolidation
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Consolidate and enhance the HR management system by fixing existing issues, improving performance, and adding new capabilities to create a comprehensive, scalable platform for hotel employee onboarding management. This builds on the existing working foundation to address technical debt, enhance user experience, and add advanced features.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Manager Dashboard Experience

As a hotel manager, I want an improved dashboard with real-time updates, better performance, and mobile responsiveness so that I can efficiently manage employee onboarding from any device at any time.

**Workflow**: Manager logs in and immediately sees up-to-date metrics, receives real-time notifications for new applications, can quickly process onboarding reviews on mobile devices, and experiences fast load times even with large datasets.

### Comprehensive HR Analytics and Reporting

As an HR administrator, I want advanced analytics with customizable reports, bulk operations, and audit trails so that I can efficiently manage multiple properties and ensure compliance across the organization.

**Workflow**: HR admin accesses enhanced analytics dashboard, creates custom reports filtered by date ranges and properties, performs bulk operations on applications, and reviews detailed audit logs for compliance purposes.

### Real-Time System Notifications

As both a manager and HR admin, I want real-time notifications and status updates so that I can respond quickly to time-sensitive onboarding activities and compliance deadlines.

**Workflow**: User receives instant notifications for new applications, approaching I-9 deadlines, pending reviews, and system issues through multiple channels (in-app, email, optional SMS).
