# Property Isolation Security Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the critical security implementation for property-scoped employee searches to prevent cross-property data access in the Hotel Employee Onboarding System.

## Security Requirement
**CRITICAL**: Employee searches MUST be scoped to the property - managers should NEVER see employees from other properties.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Secure Method Added
**File**: `/app/supabase_service_enhanced.py`
**Method**: `get_employee_by_email_and_property()`

```python
async def get_employee_by_email_and_property(self, email: str, property_id: str) -> Optional[Employee]:
    """
    Get employee by email address SCOPED TO A SPECIFIC PROPERTY.
    This is a CRITICAL security method to prevent cross-property data access.
    """
```

**Key Features**:
- Requires both email AND property_id
- Returns None if property_id is not provided (fail-safe)
- Logs security warnings for audit trail
- Creates audit log entries for all searches

### 2. Single-Step Invitation Validation Updated
**File**: `/app/main_enhanced.py`
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/onboarding/single-step/{token}`

**Changes**:
- Now uses `get_employee_by_email_and_property()` instead of direct database query
- Enhanced security logging with "SECURITY:" prefix
- Proper error handling if search fails

### 3. Employee Search Method Enhanced
**File**: `/app/supabase_service_enhanced.py`
**Method**: `search_employees()`

**Security Enhancements**:
- Added security logging when searches are performed without property_id
- Warns in logs when property filter is missing
- Logs when property filter is properly applied

## Security Verification

### Test Script
A test script has been created at `/test_property_isolation.py` to verify:
1. Searches without property_id trigger warnings
2. Searches with property_id are properly scoped
3. The new secure method rejects searches without property_id
4. Cross-property access is prevented

### Running the Test
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_property_isolation.py
```

## Database Schema Notes
- Employee email is stored in `personal_info` JSON field, not as a direct column
- Property isolation is enforced at the query level using `.eq('property_id', property_id)`
- All employee searches should use the JSON accessor: `personal_info->>email`

## Audit Trail
All employee searches through the new secure method create audit log entries with:
- Search type: "email_and_property"
- Email searched
- Property ID used
- Whether employee was found

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Always** use `get_employee_by_email_and_property()` for email-based employee searches
2. **Never** search employees without a property_id filter (except for HR users)
3. **Always** validate property_id is provided before searches
4. **Log** all security-relevant operations with "SECURITY:" prefix

### For Code Reviews
Check for:
- Direct database queries on employees table without property filtering
- Missing property_id validation
- Proper error handling when property_id is missing
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Access Control Matrix

| Role    | Can Search All Properties | Can Search Own Properties | Requires Property Filter |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| HR      | ✓                        | ✓                         | No (but recommended)    |
| Manager | ✗                        | ✓                         | Yes (enforced)          |
| Employee| ✗                        | ✗                         | N/A                     |

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Log Patterns to Monitor
- `SECURITY WARNING: Attempted to search for employee without property_id`
- `SECURITY ERROR: Failed to search for existing employee`
- `SECURITY: Employee search attempted without property_id filter`

### Recommended Alerts
1. Alert on any employee search without property_id by non-HR users
2. Alert on repeated failed search attempts
3. Alert on cross-property access attempts

## Compliance
This implementation ensures compliance with:
- Data privacy regulations requiring tenant isolation
- Industry best practices for multi-tenant SaaS applications
- Federal requirements for employee data protection

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify managers cannot see employees from other properties
- [ ] Verify HR users can see all employees (by design)
- [ ] Verify searches without property_id are rejected for managers
- [ ] Verify audit logs are created for all searches
- [ ] Verify error handling when property_id is invalid
- [ ] Test with multiple properties to ensure complete isolation

## Future Enhancements
1. Add rate limiting to prevent search abuse
2. Implement row-level security (RLS) in Supabase for additional protection
3. Add property-based caching to improve performance
4. Implement comprehensive search analytics
