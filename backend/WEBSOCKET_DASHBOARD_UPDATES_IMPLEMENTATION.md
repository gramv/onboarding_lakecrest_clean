# WebSocket Dashboard Auto-Refresh Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic dashboard data refresh triggered by WebSocket events for both Manager and HR dashboards. The dashboards now respond to real-time events without requiring manual page refresh.

## Implementation Date
August 16, 2025

## Files Modified

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Manager Dashboard Layout
**File**: `/src/components/layouts/ManagerDashboardLayout.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added state for tracking refresh status and update messages
- Enhanced WebSocket event handling to trigger data refresh
- Added visual indicators for data updates
- Implemented smooth transition animations during refresh
- Added notification bell pulse animation for new notifications
- Pass `lastUpdateTime` and `isRefreshing` through outlet context

**Supported Events**:
- `application_created` / `new_application` - Refreshes stats and shows toast
- `application_approved` / `application_rejected` - Updates stats and applications
- `manager_review_needed` - Increments notifications and refreshes data
- `onboarding_completed` - Updates employee stats
- `notification_created` - Increments notification count with pulse animation

#### 2. HR Dashboard Layout
**File**: `/src/components/layouts/HRDashboardLayout.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added recent activity feed to show real-time updates
- Enhanced WebSocket event handling for system-wide updates
- Added visual refresh indicators
- Implemented activity tracking with timestamps
- Pass `lastUpdateTime` and `isRefreshing` through outlet context

**Supported Events**:
- `application_created` - System-wide application tracking
- `application_approved` / `application_rejected` - Status change tracking
- `manager_assigned` - Manager assignment updates
- `property_created` / `property_updated` / `property_deleted` - Property management
- `onboarding_completed` - Employee onboarding tracking
- `compliance_alert` - Compliance issue notifications

#### 3. Applications Tab
**File**: `/src/components/dashboard/ApplicationsTab.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added auto-refresh based on parent dashboard WebSocket events
- Implemented visual loading indicators during refresh
- Added refresh button with spin animation
- Responds to `lastUpdateTime` from outlet context
- Fixed axios import issue (using apiClient consistently)
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds as fallback

#### 4. Employees Tab
**File**: `/src/components/dashboard/EmployeesTab.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added auto-refresh based on parent dashboard WebSocket events
- Implemented visual loading indicators
- Added refresh button with spin animation
- Responds to `lastUpdateTime` from outlet context
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds as fallback

#### 5. Global Styles
**File**: `/src/App.css`

**Added Animations**:
- `slide-in` - Smooth slide-in for update messages
- `slide-down` - Activity feed and alerts
- `fade-in` - Gentle fade for content updates
- `pulse-soft` - Subtle pulse for updating content
- `shimmer` - Loading effect for data refresh
- Notification bell pulse animation
- Smooth opacity transitions

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-Time Data Updates
- Dashboards automatically refresh when relevant WebSocket events are received
- No manual refresh required for:
  - New applications
  - Application status changes
  - Employee onboarding completion
  - Property updates
  - Manager assignments

### 2. Visual Feedback
- **Update Indicators**: Blue spinning icon with "Updating..." text
- **Smooth Transitions**: Content fades slightly during refresh (90% opacity)
- **Activity Feed** (HR Dashboard): Shows last 5 activities with timestamps
- **Notification Badge**: Pulse animation when new notifications arrive
- **Connection Status**: Real-time WebSocket connection indicator (dev mode)

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Selective refresh based on event type
- Debounced updates to prevent excessive refreshing
- Child components check `lastUpdateTime` to avoid duplicate fetches
- Auto-refresh fallback every 60 seconds for data consistency

### 4. User Experience
- Non-intrusive updates (no jarring UI changes)
- Clear visual indicators when data is being refreshed
- Toast notifications for important events
- Activity history for HR users to track system-wide changes

## WebSocket Event Flow

```
Backend Event → WebSocket Server → Dashboard Layout → Update State → Child Components
                                          ↓
                                   Trigger Refresh
                                          ↓
                                   Visual Indicator
                                          ↓
                                     Update Data
                                          ↓
                                    Remove Indicator
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open Manager or HR dashboard in browser
2. Log in with appropriate credentials
3. In another browser/incognito window, create a new application
4. Observe the first dashboard automatically update with:
   - Stats refresh
   - Toast notification
   - Update indicator
   - New data in tables

### WebSocket Events to Test
- Create new job application
- Approve/reject application
- Complete employee onboarding
- Create/update property (HR only)
- Assign manager to property (HR only)

### Test Script
Created `/test_websocket_dashboard_updates.py` for testing WebSocket events (requires authentication token for production use).

## Benefits

1. **Real-Time Awareness**: Users see changes immediately without manual refresh
2. **Improved Workflow**: Managers can respond quickly to new applications
3. **Better Collaboration**: Multiple users see the same up-to-date information
4. **Reduced Server Load**: Selective updates instead of constant polling
5. **Enhanced UX**: Smooth, non-disruptive updates with clear visual feedback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Selective Component Updates**: Only refresh specific components based on event type
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, rollback if server fails
3. **Offline Support**: Queue updates when connection is lost
4. **Event Filtering**: Allow users to customize which events trigger updates
5. **Sound Notifications**: Optional audio alerts for critical events
6. **Desktop Notifications**: Browser notifications for important events

## Notes

- WebSocket authentication is properly enforced (403 for unauthorized connections)
- Connection automatically reconnects on failure
- All updates maintain data consistency
- No sensitive data is exposed through WebSocket events
- Events are property-scoped for managers (security maintained)
