## Sample Working URL

After approval, employees receive this onboarding URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/onboard?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbXBsb3llZV9pZCI6IjdmNGFjY2M0LWY2ZTEtNGI4Ni04N2VmLTEwNDM0OWZiMjdmYyIsImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjpudWxsLCJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoib25ib2FyZGluZyIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTI3NTE4NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU1NTM0Mzg1LCJqdGkiOiJSVlgwN1M5UTlJcVhvUHV1SHJuU2d3In0.J8-mnoiymLKj2N1lwhI59mupfF_LWmsz7DCNg96fOzg
```

This token:
- Contains employee ID
- Valid for 72 hours
- Can be used to start onboarding
- Properly authenticated by backend

---

## Key Findings

### Successful Elements
1. **Authentication Flow**: Manager login generates valid JWT tokens
2. **Data Retrieval**: Applications are properly filtered by property
3. **Approval Process**: Form data submission (not JSON) works correctly
4. **Token Generation**: Onboarding tokens are created with proper claims
5. **Portal Access**: Tokens grant access to employee onboarding

### Important Implementation Notes
1. **Form Data Required**: Approval endpoint requires Form data, not JSON
2. **Success Wrapper**: API responses use success wrapper format
3. **Property Isolation**: Managers only see their property's data
4. **Token Structure**: Onboarding tokens include employee_id and expiration
