# Manager Review System - Implementation Progress

## üéØ Project Overview

Implement complete manager review workflow where:
1. Employee completes onboarding ‚Üí Manager receives notification
2. Manager reviews all signed documents

- [ ] Integrate existing `I9Section2Form.tsx`

**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours

### ‚è≥ Phase 5: I-9 Section 2 Integration (PENDING)
- [ ] Update I-9 Section 2 form to save to new schema
- [ ] Generate combined I-9 PDF (Section 1 + Section 2)
- [ ] Update employee status after completion
- [ ] Send notifications to HR

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### ‚è≥ Phase 6: Notifications & Reminders (PENDING)
- [ ] In-app notification system
- [ ] I-9 deadline reminder emails (1 day before)
- [ ] I-9 overdue alerts
- [ ] HR notification when manager completes review

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### ‚è≥ Phase 7: Testing & Integration (PENDING)
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] I-9 deadline calculation testing
- [ ] Document retrieval and viewing testing
- [ ] Manager signature capture testing
- [ ] Federal compliance validation testing
- [ ] Multi-property isolation testing

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

## üîê Security Architecture (VERIFIED ‚úÖ)

### Multi-Layer Security:
1. **Database RLS Policies** - Blocks unauthorized queries at DB level
2. **Property-Based Storage** - Physical file isolation by property
3. **Application Authorization** - Validates every API request
4. **Audit Logging** - Tracks all access attempts

### Data Isolation Guarantees:
- ‚úÖ Employees see ONLY their own documents
- ‚úÖ Managers see ONLY employees in their assigned properties
- ‚úÖ HR sees everything (for compliance)
- ‚úÖ All enforced at database, application, and storage levels

---

## üìã Federal Compliance Requirements

### I-9 Form (USCIS):
- ‚úÖ **Section 1**: Employee completes (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- ‚úÖ **Section 2**: Manager MUST complete within 3 business days (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
- ‚úÖ Manager must physically examine original documents
- ‚úÖ Manager signature is LEGALLY REQUIRED

### W-4 Form (IRS):
- ‚úÖ Employee completes and signs (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- ‚ùå NO manager signature required
- ‚úÖ Manager should review but not sign

### Other Documents:
- Direct Deposit: Manager reviews, no signature
- Health Insurance: Manager reviews, no signature
- Company Policies: Manager reviews, no signature
- Weapons Policy: Manager reviews, no signature

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Columns in `employees` Table:
```sql
manager_review_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending_review'
manager_review_started_at TIMESTAMP
manager_review_completed_at TIMESTAMP
manager_reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES users(id)
manager_review_comments TEXT
i9_section2_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending'
i9_section2_completed_at TIMESTAMP
i9_section2_deadline DATE
i9_section2_completed_by UUID REFERENCES users(id)
```

### New Table: `manager_review_actions`
```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
employee_id UUID REFERENCES employees(id)
manager_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)
action_type VARCHAR(50) -- 'started_review', 'viewed_document', 'approved', etc.
document_type VARCHAR(100) -- 'i9_section1', 'w4', 'direct_deposit', etc.
comments TEXT
metadata JSONB -- IP address, user agent, timestamps
created_at TIMESTAMP
```

### Helper Functions:
- `calculate_i9_section2_deadline(start_date)` - Returns deadline date
- `get_i9_deadline_days_remaining(deadline_date)` - Returns days remaining

### Views:
- `employees_pending_manager_review` - Quick query for pending reviews
- `i9_section2_compliance_status` - Federal compliance tracking

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Run Migration 007** in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Follow instructions in `backend/MIGRATION_007_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Verify all tables, columns, and functions created successfully

2. **After Migration Success:**
   - Proceed to Phase 2: Backend API implementation
   - Create document retrieval endpoints
   - Create review action endpoints
